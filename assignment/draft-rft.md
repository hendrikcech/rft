# Introduction

This RFC is a commentary on the difficulty of deciding upon an acceptably
distinctive hostname for one's computer, a problem which grows in direct
proportion to the logarithmically increasing size of the Internet.

Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Except to TS Eliot.

And, for that matter, to David Addison, who hates iambic pentameter.

# Poetry


# Credits


# Security Considerations

Security issues are not discussed in this memo.

Particularly the cardiac security of certain famous poets.
